How do you sort a list? Sort the first half, sort the second half, then merge the 
two sorted lists beginning to end.  Recursively or iteratively, guaranteed to finish
in precisely n log n moves (assignments) and always fewer than n log n comparisons.
Sort pointers to long data. Rquires second list of pointers equally long as first.
